When it comes to Swift source code editing, nothing beats Xcode 6.3! That
includes Xcode 6.2, which drove me to good'O Vim for a while.

Except it's not the old Vim, I'm trying out [NeoVim](http://neovim.org). The
most noticable difference in NeoVim compared to Vim is its recent
addition of a built-in terminal.

With the help of syntax highlighting and a Makefile, working with Swift this
way turns out to be a fine alternative.

(As a side benefit, I'm forced to use only local-context autocompletion. Now
I can actually spell out full UIKit APIs ðŸ˜‰.)

Here's a gif:

Some details are easy to miss. I pressed `,m`, `,` being my binding for
`<leader>`. A terminal session launched with the `make` command running. When
that's done, I could press any key and the terminal pane was dismissed. Since
`test` is the default target in my `Makefile`, the test suit for my Swift
codes actually ran.

Here's how the shortcut is set in `.nvimrc`:

    if has('nvim')
        nnoremap <leader>m :rightbelow vertical split <bar> :term make<cr>
    endif

The makefile is pretty straightforword if you've worked with `xcodebuild`.


    test :
        @xcodebuild test -project ProjectName.xcodeproj -scheme SchemeName -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 6' | xcpretty

    clean :
        @xcodebuild clean

[xcpretty](https://github.com/supermarin/xcpretty) is a nifty script that
makes `xcodebuild`s output much more readable.


Happy vimming, Swifties :)
