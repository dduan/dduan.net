I use KDE on Arch Linux for 80% of the time, OS X the other 20%. But I
got a copy of Windows 8 Pro for free as student so I decided to install it
along with Visual Studio 2012 Ultimate so that if I ever need to develop on any
Microsoft platforms, I'll have the environment ready. I jogged down these
impression after about a 30 minutes trial.

What I didn't like:

*   I have to use a .iso file the hardway (in my case, burning it to an 
    usb drive)even if I only wanted to upgrade from Windows 7.
*   When upgrading from Windows 7, only the free space is counted as usable
    for the new system, which means upgrading is not an option for I have a
    mere 26G partition reserved for Windows.
*   The old Mobile ATI graphic card driver stopped working after installation.
*   Apps don't share same session between the tile and deskop interface.
*   Contacts from different accounts (in my case, facebook and twitter) are
    mixed together and there doesn't seem to be an easy way to filter them.
*   I signed in with a Mircrosoft account for the operating system. But when
    I started Visual Studio, it asked me to sign in with the same account.

What I did like:

*   The tile interface looked nice.
*   IE10 is fast. Looked particularly smooth under the tile interface.
*   For an old machine I installed it on, the whole system is very responsive.
*   The tile interface is not unintuitive. When in doubt, one of these actions
    always gets me where I wanted:
    1.  Mouse to upper-right corner.
    2.  Mouse to upper-left corner and then move down.
    3.  Press the Win key on keyboard.

I'm not going to speculate on whether the general public will love or hate
this version of Windows. But one thing is for sure: there is going to be an
reaction. I can see it go both ways.
