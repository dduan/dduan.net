      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/LucasTizma">Shannon</a> has praised Kite at work a bunch of times and we finally got
a version of these praises in words! Having read this post, Kite remindes me of
Flash (the program), which I spent countless hours playing with and learning
about animation for the first time. Good memories.</p>

      <p>In my very limited reading-only experience about Lenses, this is the first
article that acknoledges Swift’s value type and the fact that it makes
getter/setter aspect of lenses kind of pointless. But it moves on to explain why
lenses/prisms still can be useful in a concrete and approachable way.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the bonus discussion about duality at the end, too!</p>

      <p>This is an article I wish I had writen. It has everything about Swift and C, as stated in the title. It’s
going to be a useful reference to me. I also wish I’d discovered it earlier.</p>

      <p>An oldie but goodie from Swift Evelution.
<a href="https://twitter.com/slava_pestov">Slava</a>’s answer:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“when we talk about the ABI, we’re really talking about three orthogonal
“axes” along which we would like to “move” without breaking compatibility with
existing binaries:”</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>The first axis is the machine-level calling conventions and memory layout.
For example, what registers to pass function arguments and returns in, the
rules for alignment and padding of fields in an aggregate type, which entry
points the Swift runtime exports and what their behavior should be. Once we
commit to a stable ABI along this axis, you will get interoperability between
<em>compiler versions</em> – the same exact library built with one version of the
compiler will remain compatible with clients after being recompiled with
another version, because their conventions will match up. Note that this does
not help you if the library itself changes in any way.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The second axis is the resilience work I called out in my previous e-mail.
Here, we’re trying to define language features and implementation techniques
that allow a library to evolve in a forward-compatible manner, as long as the
developer follows certain guidelines. Here, the goal is if you should be able
to compile your library, make some changes to add new APIs, and recompile it
<em>with the same compiler</em>, without breaking downstream clients, as long as you
follow the library evolution guidelines (Also, you can imagine one day having
an ‘ABI diff’ tool to automate this).  &gt;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The third axis is the standard library itself. Stability of runtime
interfaces and the extra indirection to enable resilience is all great, but it
won’t help you as long as the standard library API is evolving in a
non-backwards compatible manner – for example, if we remove a method on
String. So once the other two areas have been addressed, the last thing to lock
down is the standard library interface itself.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The rest of the thread is worth reading too. John McCall gave an high level
<a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20160808/026145.html">description</a>.</p>

<p>The definitive source for Slava’s third axes is the <a href="https://github.com/apple/swift/blob/master/docs/LibraryEvolution.rst">Library
Evolution</a>
doc from the Swift repository.</p>
