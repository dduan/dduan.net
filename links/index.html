      <p>This announcement comes with some answers to “what should be in the Swift
standard library?”</p>

<p>Notably:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost all library features can be composed from existing features with enough
effort. To be considered for addition to the library, a proposed feature must
satisfy two conditions: it must provide functionality that is useful to
a substantial population of Swift programmers, and it must provide substantial
advantages over the alternative ways of accomplishing that functionality.
Potential advantages include:</p>

  <p>It may be complex, challenging, or error-prone for users to implement
themselves.  It may have substantial performance advantages over a user
implementation, either because it has access to library internals or just
because the library implementation will likely be more carefully tuned.  It may
be substantially easier to work with because it composes better with other
language or library features.  It may be substantially more “fluent”: that is,
more natural to discover, use, and read in code. The implementation may involve
composing primitives in a subtle or tricky way, or the primitives may be
unfamiliar to many programmers. This is a more subjective criterion than the
others, and people may reasonably differ about how to apply it.  For example,
consider adding an method to rotate the elements of an array. This operation can
be performed using a relatively simple composition of slicing and concatenation:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>array = array[amount...] + array[..&lt;amount]
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>However, a method to rotate an array in-place would still be welcome: it would
have substantial performance advantages, it would avoid several potential
off-by-one errors, and it would be significantly easier for a reader to
recognize as a rotation.</p>

  <p>In contrast, a property like <code class="highlighter-rouge">isNotEmpty</code> offers no substantial advantages over
<code class="highlighter-rouge">!isEmpty</code>, and adding it would open the door to adding trivial negations of
essentially every predicate.</p>

      <p>In this awesome post, <a href="https://twitter.com/xwu">Xiaodi</a> summarizes the design
space for string literals with a focus on <strong>raw strings</strong> and <strong>custom
dilimiters</strong>. Then he proceed to some conclusions in Swift’s potential design
for raw string literals.</p>

<p>I had the feeling that this is one of those things I’d benefit from re-reading
over and over in the future.</p>

      <p><a href="https://twitter.com/LucasTizma">Shannon</a> has praised Kite at work a bunch of times and we finally got
a version of these praises in words! Having read this post, Kite remindes me of
Flash (the program), which I spent countless hours playing with and learning
about animation for the first time. Good memories.</p>

      <p>In my very limited reading-only experience about Lenses, this is the first
article that acknoledges Swift’s value type and the fact that it makes
getter/setter aspect of lenses kind of pointless. But it moves on to explain why
lenses/prisms still can be useful in a concrete and approachable way.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed the bonus discussion about duality at the end, too!</p>

      <p>This is an article I wish I had writen. It has everything about Swift and C, as stated in the title. It’s
going to be a useful reference to me. I also wish I’d discovered it earlier.</p>
