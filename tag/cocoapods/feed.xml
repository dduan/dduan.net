                <title>Distribution Tests</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;There are several ways to build dependencies for a Swift 3 project:
Swift Package Manager, Cocoapods, Carthage, etc. Many have an opinion on which
is the best choice for their projects. As a library author who want to help as
many people as possible, however, they can&#x27;t ignore any of them.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sometimes question the sanity of that conclusion: instead of becoming an
export in each package manager, I find myself a novice of all. Did I break
support for any of them with this project change? Is it still working on
a particular platform, say, tvOS? Can I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2f;em&gt; know?&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only way to &lt;em&gt;really&lt;&#x2f;em&gt; know is to verify yourself: both Cocoapods and
Carthage support four platforms -- iOS, macOS, watchOS, tvOS; Swift Package
Manager only works on Mac or Linux. So that&#x27;s 2*4+1=9 targets. All these
targets need is have the library in question fetched and imported. Every Swift
library author should have such verification before publishing updates of
their project.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The steps to verify can be triggered with commands: fetch and build
dependencies, build Xcode&#x2f;Swift project. To automate the process, put these
commands in a script or a Makefile. But wait, there&#x27;s more! One shouldn&#x27;t have
to create these dummy projects every time they create a new library. If all
these projects do is importing a library and attempt to build, they should
work for &lt;em&gt;any&lt;&#x2f;em&gt; library. The config in &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;&#x2f;code&gt;&#x2f;&lt;code&gt;Cocoapods&lt;&#x2f;code&gt;&#x2f;&lt;code&gt;Cartfile&lt;&#x2f;code&gt;
and the &lt;code&gt;import&lt;&#x2f;code&gt; statements just needs some strings replaced: name of the next
library, URL for its git repository, etc. And that&#x27;s a scriptable process as
well!&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To recap, one could, in theory, copy in some dummy projects, run a command to
inject information about a new library, run another command to build all these
project, verifying that support for those package managers remain functional.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, I have created &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;dduan&#x2f;DistributionTests&quot;&gt;DistributionTests&lt;&#x2f;a&gt; and put it
on &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2f;&#x2f;github.com&#x2f;dduan&#x2f;DistributionTests&quot;&gt;Github&lt;&#x2f;a&gt; ðŸ˜‰.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script &lt;code&gt;customize&lt;&#x2f;code&gt; requires 3 pieces of information of the library: its
import name, its git repository URL and a major version number. The assumption
here is the library generates uniformly named artifacts: the file name for
&lt;code&gt;.framework&lt;&#x2f;code&gt; and the name users use to import it are the same. Testing
distribution of a library is as simple as:&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;clone the project.&lt;&#x2f;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;customize the project with &lt;code&gt;customize&lt;&#x2f;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2f;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;run &lt;code&gt;make&lt;&#x2f;code&gt;.&lt;&#x2f;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2f;ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you do step 1 and 2, include the projects in library&#x27;s repository, then
only step 3 is necessary! This makes testing distribution methods trivial on
a continuous integration server.&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go forth and create fearlessly!&lt;&#x2f;p&gt;
