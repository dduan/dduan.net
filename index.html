    <p>It‚Äôs a few weeks before WWDC, so naturally¬π it‚Äôs time to try build your Swift
projects in the compiler‚Äôs compatibility mode!</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Download and install a snapshot for the next major version <a href="https://swift.org/download/">on
Swift.org</a>.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/2017/05/download-swift-snapshot.png" alt="download swift toolchain" />
 <img src="/assets/2017/05/install-swift-snapshot.png" alt="install swift toolchain" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose the newly installed toolchain in Xcode.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/2017/05/choose-toolchain.png" alt="choose swift toolchain in Xcode" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask the compiler to use compatibility mode. This means using the complier
flag <code class="highlighter-rouge">-swift-version X</code>, where ‚ÄúX‚Äù is the <em>current</em> major Swift version.</p>

    <p>In project‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild Settings‚Äù, value for ‚ÄúOther Swift Flags‚Äù should
 contain <code class="highlighter-rouge">-swift-version X</code>. This could mean setting it in Xcode, in
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">.xcconfig</code> files you are using and/or in your dependency managers such
 as Cocoapods.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/2017/05/compat-mode-flag.png" alt="compatibility flag in xcode" /></p>

    <p>For example, with Cocoapods, you‚Äôll need to add the following in your
 <code class="highlighter-rouge">Podfile</code> to compile 3rd party libraries in compatibility mode:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code> post_install do |installer|
     installer.pods_projects.targets.each do |target|
         target.build_configurations.each do |config|
             config.build_settings["OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS"] = "$(inherited) -swift-version 3"
         end
     end
 end
</code></pre>
    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build your project! This is where things start to get exciting.</p>

    <p>You should expect some warnings. Hopefully they are self-explanatory
enough. Most of them should correspond to <a href="https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/">a swift-evolution
proposal</a>.</p>

    <p>Improvement to the language or compiler usually means some of these
warnings tell you problems in your code that has been ignored by the
compiler previously. Fix them today!</p>

    <p>The project should compile successfully in compatibility mode (despite
warnings). This where you can stop reading. Go celebrate with your
coworkers, friends, and family!</p>

    <p>Things could go wrong for compiler snapshots, of course. Read on if see
errors or crashes (whaaaaat üò∏).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It‚Äôs time to tell the compiler team about the error or crash you encountered.</p>

    <p>Reduce the error or crash to a state that your are comfortable reporting in
public. Then go to <a href="https://bugs.swift.org">bugs.swift.org</a> and file a JIRA
ticket describing the error or compiler crash.</p>

    <p>During the process of code reduction you may find ways to work around the
compile error or crash. Make the changes for the workaround and repeat
steps 4-5. Maybe your project will compile this time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The issue you discovered will be fixed in the official Swift release come
fall. You‚Äôve ensured a smooth Swift upgrade for your project and contributed
to the Swift community üéâ!</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<p>¬π source compatibility mode is a thing starting with Swift 4. As new
major version of Swift is released, code written in the previous version should
compile without change in compatibility mode.</p>

      <div class="post-tags">
      
        <a href="/tag/swift-evolution">Swift Evolution</a>,
      
        <a href="/tag/email">Email</a>
      
      </div>
      
    </div>
    <p><em>One common complains on the Swift Evolution mailing list is about its
inscrutable interface. If you see an inactive thread on the web archive but
haven‚Äôt subscribed, there seems to be no way to participate or ‚Äúrevive‚Äù it
since you never received any of its emails.</em></p>

<p><em>With a <a href="https://lists.swift.org/pipermail/swift-evolution/Week-of-Mon-20170206/031537.html">hint</a> and some experiments, I‚Äôve discovered that there is
a way. This post reveals the magic step by step (without commenting on the
merits of email or this solution).</em></p>

<p>Like HTTP, Email is a text-based <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822">protocol</a>. Unlike HTTP, we directly
consume payloads of this protocol and, as a consequence, don‚Äôt think much about
that very fact.</p>

<p>Like HTTP, each email includes headers hidden by normal email clients. Each
header is essentially two strings, a key and a value, separated by a colon.
Among these headers are <code class="highlighter-rouge">Message-Id</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">In-Reply-To</code>. When we tell our email
client applications to start a reply, they take the value from <code class="highlighter-rouge">Message-Id</code>
and use it as value for <code class="highlighter-rouge">In-Reply-To</code> automatically.</p>

<p>To observe all this in action, we can open some emails with our favorite text
editors and look for these headers. Of course, this require us to know where the
emails exist as files. On macOS, an easy thing to do is to drag from Mail.app to
Finder/Desktop and open the resulting .eml file:</p>

<p><img src="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/2017/02/open-email.gif" alt="Open an email in text editors" /></p>

<p>Among the (perhaps overwhelming amount of) headers, we‚Äôll find the two fields we
are looking for:</p>

<p><img src="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/2017/02/email-headers.png" alt="Email Headers Message-Id and
In-Reply-To" /></p>

<p>‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll leave the clients‚Äô reply behavior regarding these fields for the reader
to verify.</p>

<p>Mailing list software such as GNU Mailman, which <a href="https://swift.org">swift.org</a> and <a href="http://llvm.org">llvm.org</a>
use to host various mailing lists, associate emails in threads by chaining them
with the headers explained above, among other things. As long as we have
a message‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">Message-Id</code>, we can reply to it ‚Äúofficially‚Äù by adding its value to
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">In-Reply-To</code> header in our email, regardless of whether we have received
that email ourselves previously.</p>

<p>So here are the steps to reply retroactively to a mailing list thread.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>find <code class="highlighter-rouge">Message-Id</code> of the mailing list message we want to reply to.</strong></p>

    <p>This value is contained in the mailing list web archive‚Äôs <code class="highlighter-rouge">mailto</code> link.
Unfortunately Mail.app doesn‚Äôt recognize it. It‚Äôs easy enough to find it
ourselves though:</p>

    <p><img src="http://0.0.0.0:4000/assets/2017/02/find-message-id.gif" alt="Finding Message-Id on mailman
archive" /></p>

    <p>Note the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">@</code> characters are percent-quoted. We have to recover the
id values to the format
<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;alphanumerics-potentially-separated-by-dash@address.com&gt;</code>.</p>

    <p>Another way to acquire this value is from the gzip‚Äôd archive. There they
just exist as plain text. The downside is you have to dig out the message
itself first.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Add <code class="highlighter-rouge">In-Reply-To</code> header to our email.</strong></p>

    <p>Draft a new email, make its title the same as our email chain‚Äôs title (this
is a good idea because lots of email <em>clients</em> do use the title to thread
messages). Set the appropriate recipients, and CCs, including the mailing
list‚Äôs address. Now save this email as draft and open it in a text editor as
we did in our investigations.  Add in the line
<code class="highlighter-rouge">In-Reply-To: &lt;id-we-found-in-step-one.address.com&gt;</code>, save it. Then send this
email (for example, open it with Mail.app and use Message-&gt;Send Again in the
menu).</p>

    <p>Of course, some email client <a href="http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/thunderbird-threading.html">supports</a> adding it
from their GUI.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You‚Äôll find the in addition to functioning as an normal message to the
recipients, the mailing list will properly put your message to the original
thread (in the case of swift-evolution, only if your reply is within the same
week).</p>

    <p>I spent a whole day making changes to this site.</p>

<p>You may notice a new section is now added: <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/links">links</a>. Yes,
I want a link list format for this site. Often I find stuff that‚Äôs insightful
and not always visible. I want to collect those and bookmark them here.
Modelling after <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>, I‚Äôve added a new
<a href="http://dduan.net/articles/feed.xml">feed</a> which only contains long-form,
original articles. I‚Äôll be tagging the links so that they show up along side my
normal posts in tag pages. Each tag page now gets its own feed! You can read
about it in the <a href="http://0.0.0.0:4000/about/">about page</a>.</p>

<p>A few small issues has been fixed.</p>

<p>I wrote the most Ruby in my life today. Yay?</p>
