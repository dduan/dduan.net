I'm a iOS engineer at Lyft. I also work on open source projects such as
[Swift][swift] and [Just][just].

Sometimes I make videos and post them on [YouTube][youtube].

I post on [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github] way more frequently.

## Syndicated Feeds ##

There are a few ways to subscribe to this site.

The main feed for everything:

> [{{ site.url }}/feed.xml]({{ site.url }}/feed.xml)

The article-only feed contains only the longer, feature articles:

> [{{ site.url }}/articles/feed.xml]({{ site.url }}/articles/feed.xml)

The tag-specific feed contains links and articles about a tag. You can
subscribe by going to page for the desired tag and append "feed.xml" to the
end of its URL. For example, the feed for everything tagged with "Swift" is:

> [{{ site.url }}/tag/swift/feed.xml]({{ site.url }}/tag/swift/feed.xml)
