In this awesome post, [Xiaodi](https://twitter.com/xwu) summarizes the design
space for string literals with a focus on **raw strings** and **custom
dilimiters**. Then he proceed to some conclusions in Swift's potential design
for raw string literals.

I had the feeling that this is one of those things I'd benefit from re-reading
over and over in the future.
