In my very limited reading-only experience about Lenses, this is the first
article that acknoledges Swift's value type and the fact that it makes
getter/setter aspect of lenses kind of pointless. But it moves on to explain why
lenses/prisms still can be useful in a concrete and approachable way.

I really enjoyed the bonus discussion about duality at the end, too!
