# Site Improvements

tag: Jekyll

I spent a whole day making changes to this site.

You may notice a new section is now added: [links](/links). Yes,
I want a link list format for this site. Often I find stuff that's insightful
and not always visible. I want to collect those and bookmark them here.
Modelling after [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net), I've added a new
[feed](http://duan.ca/articles/feed.xml) which only contains long-form,
original articles. I'll be tagging the links so that they show up along side my
normal posts in tag pages. Each tag page now gets its own feed! You can read
about it in the [about page](/).

A few small issues has been fixed.

I wrote the most Ruby in my life today. Yay?
