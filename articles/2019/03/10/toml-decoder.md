# TOML Decoder Playlist

I enjoyed making [TOMLDeserializer][] and [TOMLDecoder][] recently. Let's hope
some projects will pick them up and TOML as a configuration format will start to
spead in Swift communities.

What's outstanding about these projects is that I started working on them while
[streaming][]. Personally, I consume a lot of content like this. So now people
can watch me writing Swift, too.

I've been archiving recordings of these streams as much as I can. Here are the
links to these videos, each is around 1-1.5 hours long:

- [Turn TOML Test Fixtures Into XCTests With Vim Macros](https://youtu.be/XLLlCEfuFLw)
- [Passing TOML Deserialization Tests](https://youtu.be/Ztq3K3cq8f0)
- [Finishing TOML Invalidation Tests](https://youtu.be/GTCYSIc6n3U)
- [TOML Decoder: The Beginning](https://youtu.be/HP2Wzh8MVvg)
- [TOML Decoder: Filling In Missing Implementation Pieces](https://youtu.be/EZ7VpbrLkH0)
- [TOML Decoder: Adding The First TOML Decoding Strategy!](https://youtu.be/bISMVVWOHKg)
- [TOML Decoder: Project Overview And Data Decoding Support](https://youtu.be/oOOS4bnhwx4)
- [TOML Decoder: Key Decoding Strategies](https://youtu.be/9yDtXsrMtbU)
- [TOML Decoder: Project Updates](https://youtu.be/g1V872HL4Dk)

The TOMLDecoder projects would've been capture on camera entirely if I weren't
such a streaming n00b and messed up a few streams. Hilarious.
