I noticed a lot of people are playing these two games on Twitch recently: Fall Guys and Among Us.
Personally, I think Fall Guys is a pretty fun game to play and Among Us is an entertaining game to
watch. I'm glad these games are out and popular in this strange year, even though I'm not
playing either frequently (perhaps that's a mistake).

Anyways, I want to write about this observation that seems unique from me: that the in-game
characters in these two games are both blob-y, short and colorful. This similarity stuck in my head
for a while, and I'm getting increasingly anxious because those who frequently play these games
aren't making similar remarks *at all*. So, in this Sunday evening, I just had to get it out of my
head:

This animation is made from Pixelmator and Keynote. Those two along with Sketch and Final Cut Pro
make me feel invincible these days.
