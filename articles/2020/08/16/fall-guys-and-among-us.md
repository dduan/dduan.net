# Fall Guys are Among Us

I noticed a lot of people are playing these two games on Twitch recently: Fall Guys and Among Us.
Personally, I think Fall Guys is a pretty fun game to play and Among Us is an entertaining game to
watch. I'm glad these games are out and popular in this strange year, even though I'm not
playing either frequently (perhaps that's a mistake).

Anyways, I want to write about this observation that seems unique from me: that the in-game
characters in these two games are both blob-y, short and colorful. This similarity stuck in my head
for a while, and I'm getting increasingly anxious because those who frequently play these games
aren't making similar remarks *at all*. So, in this Sunday evening, I just had to get it out of my
head:

<video id="video-tag" width="100%" autoplay muted loop playsinline> 
    <source src="/assets/2020/08/FallGuysAmongUs.mov" type="video/quicktime" />  
</video>
<img id="img-tag" width="100%" src="/assets/2020/08/FallGuysAmongUs.mov">

<script type="text/javascript">
    function BrowserDetection() {
        //Check if browser is Safari, if it is, hide the <video> tag, otherwise hide the <img> tag
        if (navigator.userAgent.search("Safari") >= 0 && navigator.userAgent.search("Chrome") < 0) {
            document.getElementById('video-tag').style.display= "none";
        } else {
            document.getElementById('img-tag').style.display= "none";
        }
    }

    //And run the script. Note that the script tag needs to be run after HTML so where you place it is important. 
    BrowserDetection();
</script>

make me feel invincible these days.
