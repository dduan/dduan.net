  <p>This announcement comes with some answers to “what should be in the Swift
standard library?”</p>

<p>Notably:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Almost all library features can be composed from existing features with enough
effort. To be considered for addition to the library, a proposed feature must
satisfy two conditions: it must provide functionality that is useful to
a substantial population of Swift programmers, and it must provide substantial
advantages over the alternative ways of accomplishing that functionality.
Potential advantages include:</p>

  <p>It may be complex, challenging, or error-prone for users to implement
themselves.  It may have substantial performance advantages over a user
implementation, either because it has access to library internals or just
because the library implementation will likely be more carefully tuned.  It may
be substantially easier to work with because it composes better with other
language or library features.  It may be substantially more “fluent”: that is,
more natural to discover, use, and read in code. The implementation may involve
composing primitives in a subtle or tricky way<a class="backlink" rel="canonical" title="From duan.ca" href=https://duan.ca/linked/2018/08/se0225/>,</a> or the primitives may be
unfamiliar to many programmers. This is a more subjective criterion than the
others, and people may reasonably differ about how to apply it.  For example,
consider adding an method to rotate the elements of an array. This operation can
be performed using a relatively simple composition of slicing and concatenation:</p>

  <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>array = array[amount...] + array[..&lt;amount]
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>However, a method to rotate an array in-place would still be welcome: it would
have substantial performance advantages, it would avoid several potential
off-by-one errors, and it would be significantly easier for a reader to
recognize as a rotation.</p>

  <p>In contrast, a property like <code class="highlighter-rouge">isNotEmpty</code> offers no substantial advantages over
<code class="highlighter-rouge">!isEmpty</code>, and adding it would open the door to adding trivial negations of
essentially every predicate.</p>
